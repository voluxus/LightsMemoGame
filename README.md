# LightsMemoGame
Arduino small project I made in high school! Similar to Simon Says - observe, learn &amp; repeat! Much fun!


[GAMEPLAY]
Player clicks any of the two buttons included in the physical game hardware, either LEFT or RIGHT.
Now, game starts. One of the two diodes flash up and then you are to repeat with the corresponding button, LEFT of RIGHT. In the next step, the sequence is repeated from the start with one new element in the end.
You are to remember the sequence and try to provide correct input as long as possible.

Watch out! You need to be very focused, because the larger the light chain gets, the harder it is to not make a mistake. Buzzing sounds will help you focus on each bulb. Beware! You can see the sequence only once in each game step.

Beat your friends by establishing the best month's records, exercise your brain cells and have fun!
